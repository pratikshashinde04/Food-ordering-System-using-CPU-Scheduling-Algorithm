# Food-ordering-System-using-CPU-Scheduling-Algorithm
<br/>
Welcome to the Food Ordering System project, a web-based application designed to optimize the ordering process using CPU scheduling algorithms. This project provides users with precise information about their order's arrival time, waiting time, and turn-around time, ensuring an efficient and delightful food ordering experience.
<br/>
<h3> Features: <h3/> <br/>
Dynamic CPU Scheduling: Utilizing advanced CPU scheduling algorithms to optimize order processing and reduce waiting times.
<br/>
Real-time Updates: Users can track the progress of their orders with accurate arrival, waiting, and turn-around time calculations.<br/>
User-Friendly Interface: An intuitive and aesthetically pleasing design implemented with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to enhance the user experience.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>How to Use: <h3/> <br/>
Place Your Order: Navigate through the user-friendly interface to select and place your food order.<br/>
Track Your Order: Stay informed about your order's progress with real-time updates on arrival time, waiting time, and turn-around time.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Technologies Used:<<h3/><br/>
HTML: Structuring the content of the web pages.<br/>
CSS: Styling the interface for a visually appealing experience.<br/>
JavaScript: Implementing dynamic features and real-time calculations.<br/>
First-Come, First-Served (FCFS),  Shortest Job First (SJF), Round Robin (RR), Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF),  Priority Queue : Specify the CPU scheduling algorithm employed for order optimization.
